There are a many ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but the [cheapest method available so far](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1462901115000222) that [could have material impact on carbon dioxide levels](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/304/5677/1623) is regenerative agriculture which involves a farmer adjusting their land-use practices in ways that cause the soil to absorb carbon (which, conveniently, also increases the fertility of the soil). Doing so requires a time and/or material investment. Fortunately there are [people](https://www.terrapass.com/) [and](https://stripe.com/blog/negative-emissions-commitment) [businesses](https://news.shopify.com/we-need-to-talk-about-carbon) that would gladly pay for this carbon removal. 

The challenge is estimating, within a reasonable degree of certainty like +/- 10%, how much carbon was removed by any particular farmer’s change in land-use practices. Without that, farmer's cannot be fairly compensated for removing carbon. 

The goal is to develop a model that can take in data (such as the USDA’s open source and API-accessible statistics) and use that to produce an estimate that is somewhat reliably accurate. Doing so would let farmers estimate their potential payout for changing their practices, enabling them to forecast whether or not their effort would be worth it.
